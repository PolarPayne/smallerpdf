==========

After overhearing a business conversation that went something in the lines of:

*"I have this huge .pdf, how can I make it smaller?"*

*"That's easy! I always use smallpdf.com"*

I've got nothing against [smallpdf.com](https://smallpdf.com) - it's a great service! But for me the promise
of *"We'll delete your files! Pinky swear!"* ain't gonna cut it. I want proof, and the
best way to get it is to build my own version. And now you can have one too!

**How can I run my own?**

Easy! Just press this lil' ole button here: [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)
